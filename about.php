    <p>
    I've never set foot in a football stadium except for concerts. 
    While sports might not be a passion, I respects the dedication and love 
    the athletes put into their craft. 
    I don't have too many thoughts about sports, but two things stick out. 
    For one, not having access to the easily available small talk about last 
    night's game is something that can feel amiss when confronted in 
    conversation with a stranger. The other is of the FOMO variety; 
    what am I missing? Sports - even football in particular - are enjoyed
    by so many, regardless of geographic roots or socioeconomic standing. 
    When it gets down to it, maybe it's about the camaraderie: sharing 
    the ups and downs with your team-mates and being better at what you do
    today than you were yesterday. 
    So maybe web development and sports aren't that different after all.
